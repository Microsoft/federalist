Federalist is a unified interface for publishing static government websites. It automates common tasks for integrating GitHub, [Prose](https://github.com/prose/prose), and Amazon Web Services to provide a simple way for developers to launch new websites or more easily manage existing ones.

## Getting started

To run the server, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed. The setup process will automatically install Jekyll and its dependencies based on the `github-pages` gem.

To build sites using Hugo, install [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) and make sure it's available in your path.

We use `ngrok` to form a local tunnel and expose our local app to webhooks. Install ngrok by typing the following in a command line interface, E.g. Terminal for Mac OSX:

```
$ brew install ngrok
```

### env variables

We have a few environment variables that the application uses, here is a list of the environment variables that the application will use if present:

* `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` **required** - get this when you register your app with Github
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` **required** - you'll also get this when you register your app
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_CALLBACK_URL` - for dev you'll probably want to use http://localhost:1337/auth/github/callback
* `FEDERALIST_TEMP_DIR` - where files will be temporarily built
* `FEDERALIST_PUBLISH_DIR` - where to publish files if not S3
* `FEDERALIST_S3_BUCKET` - bucket ID to push files to on S3
* `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_URL` - should be full url; for dev: http://localhost:1337/webhook/github
* `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - random string used to protect webhook messages
* `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` - application name to report to New Relic
* `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` - license key for New Relic

You'll notice that we talk about a `/config/local.js` file below, particularly for setting up the Github app information. For local development either approach is fine, but for production environments you'll want to set these env vars instead of commit `local.js` to your history.


### Build the server

* Download or Clone this repository from Github either by using the command line or repo's website on Github. On the right side of the repo's page, there is a button that states "Clone in Desktop".
*
* Run `npm install` from the root (the directory that houses the projects files on your computer) of the repository to load modules and install Jekyll dependencies

Together these commands will look something like the following:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:18F/federalist.git
$ cd federalist
$ npm install
```

* Set up [an application on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). You'll want to use `http://localhost:1337/auth` as the "Authorization callback url". Once you have created the application, you'll see a Client ID and Client Secret. You'll need to create a JavaScript file and label it local.js. Save this file to the config folder located in the project you downloaded. Use those values in `config/local.js`

 ```
  passport: {
    github: {
      options: {
        clientID: '<<use the value from Github here>>',
        clientSecret: '<<use the value from Github here>>',
        callbackURL: 'http://localhost:1337/auth/github/callback'
      }
    }
  }
 ```

* Set webhook settings for a public endpoint and secret. Note that your ngrok subdomain (the `Vncr0qo2Yx` bit below) will be different.

  ```
  webhook: {
    endpoint: 'https://Vncr0qo2Yx.ngrok.io/webhook/github',
    secret: 'testSecret'
  }
  ```

In the end, your `local.js` file should look something like this:

```
module.exports = {
  passport: {
    github: {
      options: {
        clientID: '<<get from github>>',
        clientSecret: '<<get from github>>',
        callbackURL: 'http://localhost:1337/auth/github/callback'
      }
    }
  },
  webhook: {
    endpoint: '<<your ngrok url>>/webhook/github',
    secret: 'test secret'
  }
};
```

* Run the server with `npm start` or `node app.js` (You can use `npm run watch:server` for the server to restart when you save file changes) at the directory of the project on your local computer.


#### Build the server and the front-end
There are really two applications in one repo here. Right now we're OK with that because we're moving quick to get done with the prototypal phase of the project.

If you are working on the front-end of the application, the things you need to know are:

0. It is a Backbone based application
0. It is built with `browserify` and uses `watchify` to build on changes
0. It lives in `/assets/app`

You can use `npm run watch` to get the project built and running. This will set up `watchify` to run when front end files change and will set up the server to reload on any file change (front end included)

#### Using Postgres
By default, the application should use local disk storage in place of a database. This is easier to get started and isn't a problem for local development. In production, the app uses Postgres as the data store. To use Postgres in your local dev environment:

0. First, you'll need to [install Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/download/).
0. Next, you'll have to create the `federalist` database for the application. `$ createdb federalist` should do the trick
0. Add postgres to your `/config/local.js` file

```
connections: {
	postgres: {
		adapter: 'sails-postgresql',
		database: 'federalist'
	}
},
models: {
	connection: 'postgres'
}
```

## Architecture

This application is primarily a JSON API server based on the [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/) framework. It handles authentication, managing users, sites, and builds, and receives webhook requests from GitHub.

It automatically applies a webhook to the repository new sites and creates a new build on validated webhook requests.

The front end of the application is a [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) based application, that uses [browserify](http://www.browserify.org) in the build process. It is a very lightweight consumer of the Sails API.

### Proof of concept

The proof of concept application will have a web-based front-end to interface with the API and allow users to add new sites, configure them, and open them in Prose for editing.

It will also route requests to the published static websites, including preview sites for each branch.

### Future goals

After the initial proof of concept, development will focus on scalability by moving to the AWS platform, using S3 for publishing, SQS for managing the publishing queue, and running publishing tasks on separate servers.

Additional development will focus on improved collaboration features, such as built-in support for forking and merging branches for drafts of changes, and automatic configuration of Prose settings.

## Initial proposal

Federalist is new open source publishing system based on proven open source components and techniques. Once the text has been written, images uploaded, and a page is published, the outward-facing site will act like a simple web site -- fast, reliable, and easily scalable. Administrative tools, which require authentication and additional interactive components, can be responsive with far fewer users.  

Regardless of the system generating the content, all websites benefit from the shared editor and static hosting, which alleviates the most expensive requirements of traditional CMS-based websites and enables shared hosting for modern web applications.

From a technical perspective, a modern web publishing platform should follow the “small pieces loosely joined” API-driven approach. Three distinct functions operate together under a unified user interface:

1. **Look & feel of the website**
Templates for common use-cases like a departmental website, a single page report site, API / developer documentation, project dashboard, and internal collaboration hub can be developed and shared as open source repositories on GitHub. Agencies wishing to use a template simply create a cloned copy of the template, add their own content, and modify it to suit their needs. Social, analytics, and accessibility components will all be baked in, so all templates are in compliance with the guidelines put forth by SocialGov and Section 508.

2. **Content editing**
Content editing should be a separate application rather than built into the web server. This allows the same editing interface to be used across projects. The editing interface only needs to scale to match the load from *editors*, not *visitors*.

3. **Publishing infrastructure**
Our solution is to provide scalable, fast, and affordable static hosting for all websites. Using a website generator like Jekyll allows for these sites to be built dynamically and served statically.
